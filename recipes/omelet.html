        <ul>
            <li>3 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>1/4 cup diced smoked ham</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced onion</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons diced bell pepper</li>
            <li>Salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1/3 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>1 pinch cayenne pepper</li>

        <h3>Cooking Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all the ingredients detailed in the "Ingredients Needed" section.</li>
            <li>Beat eggs in a small bowl until just combined; do not overbeat.</li>
            <li>Melt butter in a skillet over medium-high heat. Add ham, onion, and bell pepper; season with salt and pepper. Cook and stir until onions soften and ham begins to caramelize, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Reduce heat to medium-low and pour in eggs. Mix briefly with a spatula while shaking the pan to ensure ingredients are evenly distributed.</li>
            <li>Quickly run the spatula along edges of omelet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle Cheddar cheese and cayenne pepper over omelet.</li>
            <li>Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until top is still wet but not runny, about 5 minutes. Use a spatula to fold omelet in half and transfer it to a plate.</li>
